# Code Audit Report

## Linting
- `pnpm lint` now succeeds for all apps. Warnings remain for hook dependencies in `apps/web`.

## Type Checking
- `tsc --noEmit` passes for all packages and apps.

## Build Simulation
- `pnpm --filter web build` completes with warnings about phantomjs-prebuilt but succeeds.
- `pnpm --filter creator build` and `pnpm --filter brand build` succeed after fixing missing imports.

## Issues Fixed
- Added missing ESLint config for `apps/brand`.
- Fixed JSX syntax in `apps/web/app/matches/page.tsx`.
- Rewrote `ThemeToggle` in `packages/shared-ui` to remove dependency on `@/app/providers` and manage theme locally.
- Updated `packages/shared-ui/tsconfig.json` to resolve paths correctly.
- Added `apps/creator/app/lib/auth.ts` and updated API route to import from `@lib/auth`.

## Prisma
- Basic Prisma usage checked; no unsafe raw queries found.

## Tailwind/PostCSS
- `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js` include required plugins.
